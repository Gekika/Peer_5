# Peer_5
This project is a document summarization tool built to showcase what Iâ€™ve learned during Month 5 of the Kamilimu mentorship program. 
It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Llama 3.1 model to generate concise summaries of input documents. 
The project combines document retrieval and summarization to provide users with an efficient way to understand large volumes of text.
