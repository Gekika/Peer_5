# Peer_Mentorship task five
This project is a document summarization tool built to showcase what Iâ€™ve learned during Month 5 at Kamilimu mentorship program. 
It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using the Llama 3.1 model to generate concise summaries of input documents(month 5 notes). 
The project combines document retrieval and summarization to provide users with an efficient way to understand large volumes of text.
